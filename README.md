## How to use it?
- Step 1: Download "convert_hms_to_geo_layouts.h" from [Releases](https://github.com/Swipley/convert_hms_to_geo/releases/tag/SuperMario64).
- Step 2: Put the file "convert_hms_to_geo_layout.h" inside the ```include``` folder of your decomp repo.
- Step 3: Open ```sm64.h``` on the same ```include``` folder and add `#include "convert_hms_to_geo_layouts.h"` (or you can just not do sm64.h and just include it in every group file (group(x)_geo.inc.c)
- Step 4: Save & run ```make VERSION=jp COMPARE=0``` ```make VERSION=us COMPARE=0``` ```make VERSION=eu COMPARE=0``` (this will re-compile some parts, so don't worry)
- Step 5: if you have a file which has hms data and gfx data together, simply add `#include "convert_hms_to_geo_layouts.h"` there.
